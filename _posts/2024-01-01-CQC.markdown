<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">C</span>lose Quarters Combat (CQC) training focuses on mastering techniques for engaging enemies at close range, emphasizing swift and decisive action in confined spaces. It covers skills like room clearing, weapon retention, and hand-to-hand combat, crucial for dominating in tight urban environments or enclosed structures. CQC proficiency enhances individual lethality and team coordination, ensuring readiness for intense combat encounters where split-second decisions can determine survival. </p>

**Trainers:** Ensure comprehension before advancing. Share SOPs with participants for pre-training study.

#### Game Master

Set up the following stations near the main base with adequate spacing for transitioning between locations.

1. CQC Training Facility with Various Room Configurations.
2. Observation Deck for Trainers.
3. Weapons Cache with Close Combat Weapons and Ammunition.
4. Classroom Area for Instruction and Debriefing.

#### Objective 1.0

Teach participants the deliberate entry method for conducting close quarters combat operations.

**Trainers:** Provide a detailed overview of the **deliberate entry method**, emphasizing safety and effectiveness.

### Deliberate Entry Method

#### 1. Planning and Rehearsal

- **Intelligence Gathering:** Assess available intelligence on the target structure and potential threats.
- **Mission Briefing:** Conduct a thorough mission briefing with all participants, including roles and responsibilities (e.g., RFL, TL, SAW, GL). 
- **Rehearsal:** Practice the deliberate entry method through exercises and walkthroughs.

#### 2. Execution

- **Dynamic Breach:** Execute a dynamic breach using explosive if necessary (e.g., blowing door open). 
- **Immediate Action Drills:** Perform immediate action drills upon breaching to swiftly secure the entry point and establish control of the structure.
- **Room Clearing:** Clear each room methodically, ensuring thorough coverage and minimizing the risk of surprise threats.

**Trainers:** Guide participants through practical exercises to reinforce the deliberate entry method and its application in various scenarios.

### CQC Training - Clearing via Grenades

#### Objective 2.0

Train participants on clearing structures using stun and explosive grenades when civilians are not present.

**Trainers:** Emphasize the importance of proper grenade usage and coordination in close quarters environments.

### Clearing via Grenades Procedure

#### 1. Assessment

- **Threat Analysis:** Assess the threat level and composition within the target structure.
- **Civilians Present:** Ensure there are no civilians present within the structure before employing grenades.

#### 2. Grenade Employment

- **Selection:** Choose appropriate grenades based on the target and threat assessment.
- **Placement:** Deploy grenades through doors, windows, or openings to neutralize threats and create entry points.

#### 3. Entry and Clearance

- **Explosive Breach:** Initiate the entry following grenade detonation, utilizing the element of surprise.
- **Room Clearance:** Conduct room-by-room clearance, exploiting the shock and disorientation caused by the grenades.

**Trainers:** Supervise participants during grenade employment exercises, emphasizing safety and proper techniques.

### CQC Training Debrief

#### Objective 3.0

Review participants' performance, provide feedback, and address areas for improvement.

#### 1. Performance Review

- **Individual Assessment:** Provide feedback to each participant based on their performance during the deliberate entry and grenade clearing exercises.
- **Highlight Strengths:** Recognize areas where participants demonstrated proficiency and effectiveness.

#### 2. Areas for Improvement

- **Identify Weaknesses:** Address specific areas where participants may need improvement in executing the deliberate entry method and clearing via grenades.
- **Recommendations:** Offer recommendations for additional training or drills to enhance participants' skills in close quarters combat.

#### 3. Certification

- **Criteria:** Review the criteria for CQC certification and inform participants of the requirements for successful certification.
  - **Expert:** Demonstrate proficiency in executing the deliberate entry method and clearing via grenades with high accuracy and efficiency.
  - **Proficient:** Execute the deliberate entry method and clearing via grenades with satisfactory accuracy and effectiveness.
  - **Basic:** Show a basic understanding of the deliberate entry method and clearing via grenades but require further practice and refinement.
- **Next Steps:** Provide guidance on next steps for participants to continue honing their skills in close quarters combat within their unit.

**Trainers:** Conclude the CQC training with a debrief session, allowing participants to ask questions and clarify any concerns.
