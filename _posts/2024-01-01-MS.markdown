It encompasses techniques such as proper aiming, breath control, and trigger discipline, essential for hitting targets consistently and effectively. Marksmanship proficiency not only improves individual shooting prowess but also enhances team capabilities, contributing to mission success in various operational contexts.

**Trainers:** Ensure comprehension before advancing. Share SOPs with participants for pre-training study.

### Game Master

Set up the following stations near the main base with adequate spacing for transitioning between locations.

1. Shooting Range.
2. Observation Deck for Trainers.
3. Target Area with Down-Range Targets (200M, 400M, 500M, 650M). 
4. Classroom Area for Instruction and Debriefing.

### Marksmanship Certification Training

#### Objective 1.0

Ensure participants understand the fundamentals of marksmanship and are capable of accurately engaging targets.

**Trainers:** Provide a comprehensive overview of marksmanship principles and safety procedures.

### Marksmanship Fundamentals

#### 1. Sight Alignment and Picture

- **Teaching Method:** Demonstrate proper sight alignment and picture using training aids and examples.
- **Practice:** Allow participants to practice acquiring sight alignment and picture on stationary targets.

#### 2. Breathing Control

- **Techniques:** Teach participants how to control their breathing to minimize movement while aiming.
- **Drills:** Conduct breathing control exercises, emphasizing steady aim during inhalation and exhalation.

#### 3. Trigger Control

- **Explanation:** Explain the importance of smooth trigger control for maintaining accuracy.

#### 1. Single Target Engagement

- **Distance:** Set up targets at varying distances (200M, 400M, 500M, 650M) within the effective range of the weapon.
- **Procedure:** Participants engage each target individually, focusing on accuracy and consistency.
- **Certification Criteria:**
  - Expert: Hit 90% or more of the designated targets.
  - Marksman: Hit 75% or more of the designated targets.
  - Sharpshooter: Hit 60% or more of the designated targets.

**Trainers:** Make sure to record the score and certification for each trainee at this time. 

#### 2. Multiple Target Engagement

- **Scenario:** Introduce scenarios requiring participants to engage multiple targets within a time constraint.
- **Assessment:** Evaluate participants' ability to prioritize targets and maintain accuracy under pressure.

#### 3. Moving Target Engagement

- **Introduction:** Brief participants on techniques for engaging moving targets effectively.
- **Live-Fire Drills:** Conduct exercises with moving targets to assess participants' tracking and lead estimation skills.

**Trainers:** Evaluate participants' performance during live-fire assessments, providing immediate feedback and coaching as needed.

### Marksmanship Certification Debrief

#### Objective 3.0

Review participants' performance, provide feedback, and address areas for improvement.

#### 1. Performance Review

- **Individual Assessment:** Provide feedback to each participant based on their marksmanship assessment results.
- **Highlight Strengths:** Recognize areas where participants demonstrated proficiency and skill.

#### 2. Areas for Improvement

- **Identify Weaknesses:** Address specific areas where participants may need improvement or further practice.
- **Recommendations:** Offer recommendations for additional training or drills to enhance marksmanship skills.
