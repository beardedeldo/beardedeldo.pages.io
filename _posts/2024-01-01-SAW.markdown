<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">S</span> Squad and Automatic Weapon (SAW) training is pivotal for replicating the role of providing covering fire and controlling the battlefield. SAW training equips players with the skills to effectively deploy automatic weapons, maintain suppressive fire, and coordinate with teammates to dominate engagements. Mastering SAW techniques enhances teamwork, tactical maneuvering, and overall combat effectiveness, crucial for success. </p>  

**Trainers:** Ensure comprehension before advancing. Share SOPs with participants for pre-training study.

### Game Master

Set up the following stations near the main base with adequate spacing for transitioning between locations.

1. Shooting Range.
2. Sandbag covers with down-range targets.
3. Sandbags for buddy bounding. 
4. Set up scenario: CQC and ambush. 

###  SAW Training 1: SAW Familiarization and Handling

#### Objective 1.0

Familiarize participants with the SAW and its handling.

**Trainers:** Provide a detailed overview of the SAW's components, safety procedures, and handling techniques.

### SAW Handling Procedures

#### 1. Safety Procedures

- **Clearing:** Always ensure the SAW is clear before handling.
- **Trigger Discipline:** Keep finger off the trigger until ready to fire.
- **Muzzle Awareness:** Always point the muzzle in a safe direction.

#### 2. Operating the SAW

- **Loading and Unloading:** Demonstrate proper loading and unloading procedures.
- **Clearing Jams:** Teach participants how to clear common jams quickly and safely (to be added via mod later). 
- **Keeping an eye on ammo:** Teach particpants to call out when alsmost "empty", and "need cover, reloading".

#### 3. Firing Techniques

- **Burst Fire:** Emphasize controlled bursts for accuracy and ammunition conservation.
- **Sustained Fire:** Teach participants how to maintain sustained fire while minimizing overheating.

**Trainers:** Allow participants to practice handling the SAW under supervision at the shooting range.

### SAW Training 2: Marksmanship and Target Engagement

**Trainers:** Conduct exercises at the shooting range.

#### Objective 2.0

Improve participants' marksmanship and proficiency in engaging targets with the SAW.

#### 1. SAW Marksmanship Fundamentals

- **Sight Alignment and Picture:** Teach participants how to properly align sights and acquire targets.
- **Breath Control:** Emphasize the importance of steady breathing for accuracy and shooting in bursts. 
- **Trigger Control:** Instruct on smooth trigger pulls to maintain accuracy. Note how muzzle moves up when continuous holding of trigger. 
- **Weak points:** Demonstrate shooting at weak points (on VICS = engine, tires, windows). 

#### 2. Engaging Single and Multiple Targets

- **Single Target Engagement:** Practice engaging stationary targets with controlled bursts.
- **Multiple Target Engagement:** Introduce techniques for transitioning between multiple targets efficiently, including moving VICs. 

**Trainers:** Assess participants' marksmanship skills and provide feedback for improvement.

### SAW Training 3: Fire and Maneuver Tactics

**Trainers:** Conduct exercises at the designated bunkers location.

#### Objective 3.0

Teach participants fire and maneuver tactics utilizing the SAW within a squad context.

#### 1. Suppressive Fire

- **Role of the SAW:** Explain the SAW's role in providing suppressive fire to support squad movement.
- **Sector of Fire:** Instruct participants on establishing and maintaining effective sectors of fire.

#### 2. Bound and Cover Techniques

- **Bounding Overwatch:** Teach participants how to alternate between bounding and providing covering fire -- also known as "Talking Guns". 
- **Covering Fire:** Emphasize the importance of providing effective covering fire while squad members move.

**Trainers:** Conduct live fire exercises to practice fire and maneuver tactics, grading participants based on their performance.

### SAW Training 4 (Final Exam): Tactical Scenario Simulations

#### Objective 4.0

Evaluate participants' ability to apply SAW training in realistic MILSIM scenarios.

#### Scenario-based Exercises

- **Urban Operations:** Simulate urban combat scenarios requiring effective use of the SAW in close quarters.
- **Ambush Response:** Test participants' ability to react to enemy ambushes while employing SAW tactics.
- **Defense and Counterattack:** Evaluate participants' proficiency in defending positions and launching counterattacks using the SAW.

**Trainers:** This phase assesses participants' ability to apply SAW tactics and techniques in dynamic MILSIM scenarios. Provide feedback and debrief after each exercise.
